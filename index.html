            <p>At Aryan Project Media, we create Aryan-focused films and documentaries because we recognize the unparalleled power of storytelling to shape minds and move hearts. Since our founding in 2005, we've seen the need to counter mainstream narratives
                with our own: stories that reflect the beauty, struggles, and triumphs of an Aryan white society.</p>
